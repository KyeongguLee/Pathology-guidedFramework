Pathology-Guided Metric Learning: Resting-State EEG-based Diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment using an Encoder Pre-trained on Alzheimer’s Disease

This repository contains the official implementation of a Pathology-guided Framework designed for the early detection of neurodegenerative conditions, specifically focusing on classifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) from Healthy Controls (HC) using advanced pathological patterns as a diagnostic guide.
